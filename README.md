# Artificial-Neural-Network-lab

This repository contains all my lab notebooks from the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) course. 
It includes practical implementations, experiments, and solutions covered during the ANN lab sessions. 
Each notebook provides detailed insights into neural network concepts, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Notebook 1: Spam-Ham Email Detection using SVM
This notebook focuses on classifying emails as spam or ham using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. 
It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation.
