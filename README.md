# Artificial-Neural-Network-lab

This repository contains all my lab notebooks from the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) course. 
It includes practical implementations, experiments, and solutions covered during the ANN lab sessions. 
Each notebook provides detailed insights into neural network concepts, model building, training, and evaluation.
### Notebook 1: Implementation of Custom Fit Function
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a custom fit function for training neural networks. 
Instead of relying on built-in training methods, it manually performs forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates.
### Notebook 2: Spam-Ham Email Detection using SVM
This notebook focuses on classifying emails as spam or ham using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. 
It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation.
### Notebook 3: ANN Model Preprocessing using the Heart Disease Dataset
This notebook focuses on preprocessing the Heart Disease dataset for training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). 
It includes data cleaning, feature selection, normalization, and splitting the dataset to ensure optimal model performance.
### Notebook 4: ANN with Different Activation Functions
This notebook explores the impact of different activation functions on the performance of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). 
It compares various activation functions such as ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh in terms of training efficiency and model accuracy.
### Notebook 5: ANN for Multi-Class Classification
This notebook focuses on building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for multi-class classification. 
It covers data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and performance evaluation.
